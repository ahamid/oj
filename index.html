<p>OJ(S) (OJ.js || OpenJS || Orange Julius || whatever you like) is a framework upon which to build web applications in pure (sometimes functional) JavaScript.</p>

<p>OJ is packaged for Node and Bower. Other options abound.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bower <code>bower install --save ojs</code>
</li>
<li>From NPM last stable <code>npm install --save ojs</code>
</li>
<li>Clone from Git <code>git clone git@github.com:somecallmechief/oj.git</code>
*</li>
</ul><p>There are more than a few TODOs before OJ will fully deliver on its promise, but this is the API at the core of the vision:</p>

<p>OJ is written in CoffeeScript. The distribution folder has the complete CS and JS for the project.
The source folder includes CS, JS and source maps for each individual file.
Feel free to use OJ in either flavor.
While OJ probably doesn't have a lot of utility in the context of Node, I have made an effort to keep it Node-compatible--although there is absolutely no testing to this effect.</p>

<h3>
<a name="semantics" class="anchor" href="#semantics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Semantics</h3>

<p>By design, OJ handles the generation of unique element IDs for every DOM node automatically under the hood.
This provides faster lookups in the internal API and encourages you to reference nodes in memory as opposed to relying on "truth in DOM".
For example, while you might write something like the following in jQuery:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-coffee"><pre><span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'#myHolaDiv'</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span> <span class="s">'&lt;div id="leavingDiv"&gt;Leaving...&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
<span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'#myHolaDiv'</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span> <span class="s">'&lt;div&gt;Leaving......&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
<span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'#myHolaDiv'</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span> <span class="s">'&lt;div id="goneDiv"&gt;Gone&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And at some point later fetch the node from the DOM:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-coffee"><pre><span class="nv">leaving = </span><span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'#leavingDiv'</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hide</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In OJ, this is generally discouraged. Node lookups by ID are possible (if you maintain a reference to the ID),
but it is usually better to chain in memory, preserving a reference to the object:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-coffee"><pre><span class="nv">myHolaDiv = </span><span class="nx">OJ</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nodes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">myHolaDiv</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span> <span class="s">'Leaving...'</span>
<span class="nx">myHolaDiv</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span> <span class="s">'Leaving......'</span>
<span class="nx">myHolaDiv</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span> <span class="s">'Gone'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>While frameworks like jQuery make it easy to inject anything the DOM, out of the box the framework does not encourage you to compose good HTML.
In jQuery every node wrapper is a generic DOM node with the same sets of properties and methods as every other DOM node.
In OJ, every node wrapper represents a specific type of DOM node (e.g. DIV, SPAN, TABLE) with a subset of the generic utility methods
that you might get from the jQuery API but also a highly constrained, strongly validated superset of methods
that are specific to the type of the node. For example, nothing (apart from reason) prevents one from writing this in jQuery:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-coffee"><pre><span class="nv">table = </span><span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;'</span>
<span class="nv">div = </span><span class="nx">jQuery</span> <span class="s">'&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
<span class="nx">table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span> <span class="nx">div</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In OJ, the div method does not exist on the table class and thus will generate an exception:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-coffee"><pre><span class="nv">table = </span><span class="nx">OJ</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nodes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">table</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nx">table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">#throws new TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'div'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This does come at the cost of a learning curve, but the exceptions that OJ will generate for you are intended to ferret out mistakes
that will never make their way into Production code.
While still runtime exceptions, you will see these immediately--the first time you run the code or unit tests;
and within a very short time will disappear completely.
Just as the Promise pattern enables you to write code that doesn't care about the actual order of operations,
freeing you to focus only on the sequence of logic, I think OJ enables a style of development free from worrying about the minutia
of the DOM in order to focus more on the UI/UX you want to deliver.</p>

<h2>
<a name="state-of-the-project" class="anchor" href="#state-of-the-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>State of the Project</h2>

<p>The Dream: Basic HTML and CSS are fully encapsulated in strongly validated OJ classes.
Complex forms, layouts and composites are abstracted into thin OJ classes which are extensible with mixins.
Entire workflows are simplified into OJ structures which can be defined with just a few lines (or so) of JavaScript code.
Layouts are configurable simply by clicking and dragging the form. Validation and data binding come for free.</p>

<p><del>The Reality: Some of the most complex work has already been done. The SQL Builder demo is complete, minus actual AJAX requests. A fully fledged wrapper around IndexedDb is in place. Objects are queryable using SQL-like semantics. Raw DOM nodes are wrapped and ready. Much has been done, but much more still remains to do.</del></p>

<p><del>### TODO Priority 1 v0.2.0</del> Complete
<del>The core factory class is in place, but only SPAN and DIV have been implemented. TABLE is next, followed by INPUT (which will immediately spawn a factory subclass to handle input type: radio, checkbox, etc). SELECT (with child class OPTION) will be followed by the rest of the classic DOM Nodes.</del></p>

<p>As of v0.2.0, the entire library has been refactored to CoffeeScript. Anything non-essential to the DOM framework has been archived (the source is still included in the project under /src/archive).
All standard nodes are supported: div, span, input, table, fieldset, p, b, br, ol, ul, li, select, option and more
Unit tests are in place and expanding to prove out all of the new nodes.</p>

<h3>
<a name="todo-priority-2-v030" class="anchor" href="#todo-priority-2-v030"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TODO Priority 2 v0.3.0</h3>

<p>A secondary factory will need to implement components. There's still some implementation specing to do on how to distinguish
between abstract components (e.g. an array of checkboxes) vs. concrete controls (e.g. an Address composite).</p>

<h3>
<a name="todo-priority-3-v040" class="anchor" href="#todo-priority-3-v040"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TODO Priority 3 v0.4.0</h3>

<p>A FORM factory is on the table, so to speak. Additional specification work is needed to define a data structure
which can be implicitly cast into an OJ form, generating an ordered layout of controls and to facilitate real time data.</p>
